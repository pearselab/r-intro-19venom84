# test
# 1. Write a loop that prints out the numbers from 20 to 10
for(a in 20:10) {
  print(a)
}

# 2.  Write a loop that prints out only the numbers from 20 to 10 that are even
for(b in 20:10) {
  if(b %% 2 == 0)
    print(b)
}

# 3.  Write a function that calculates whether a number is a prime number 
#     (hint: what does 2 %% 3 give you?)
